## About Building Spatial Datasets starters

This is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) project repository of starter templates for the [GES668: Building Spatial Datasets](https://bldgspatialdata.github.io/website).

```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::use_github_file("bldgspatialdatasets/starters", "final-project-presentation.qmd")
```

Make sure to remove any instructions and background information about the [Reveal.js presentation format](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) from the template.
